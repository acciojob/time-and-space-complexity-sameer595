<h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
<p>Time complexity of an algorithm quantifies the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input. Similarly, Space complexity of an algorithm quantifies the amount of space or memory taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input.Time complexity, efficient</p>
<p> <b>Space Complexity</b>– takes space directly proportional to the input size. O(n log n) – log-linear/quasilinear complexity – also called “linearithmic”, its space complexity grows proportionally to the input size and a logarithmic factor.</p>
